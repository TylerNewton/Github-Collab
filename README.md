# Github-Collab
Practice collaboration for the 1st group in Bill's class

Tyler Newton: We are doing non-fiction, so everyone will pick a random topic to make the next person do, write 1-2 sentences on whatever topic they received, and pass it on to the next person with a random topic for them to look up.

Venus 1st: look up what ore tailings are and talk about them a little! Then choose someone to pass it on to! (You can choose to send it back to me, too)
